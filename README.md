# Hadoop Platform and Application Framework
[Course Website](http://www.coursera.org/learn/hadoop/)
This class is 1 of 6 offered by UC San Diego for their Big Data Specialization certificate on Coursera. The course covers Hadoop architecture, software stack, and execution environment and walks through examples of the Hadoop and Spark frameworks.

In Week 4 of the course, we discuss the [Map/Reduce](https://github.com/juliaawu/coursera-hadoop-platform-and-application-framework/tree/master/map-reduce) framework with two exercises in Hadoop streaming using Python:
  - [Wordcount](https://github.com/juliaawu/coursera-hadoop-platform-and-application-framework/tree/master/map-reduce/wordcount-assignment)
  - [Joining Data](https://github.com/juliaawu/coursera-hadoop-platform-and-application-framework/tree/master/map-reduce/joining-data-assignment)
    * [Join 1](https://github.com/juliaawu/coursera-hadoop-platform-and-application-framework/tree/master/map-reduce/joining-data-assignment/simple-join)
    * [Join 2](https://github.com/juliaawu/coursera-hadoop-platform-and-application-framework/tree/master/map-reduce/joining-data-assignment/advanced-join)

Week 5 covers the [Spark](https://github.com/juliaawu/coursera-hadoop-platform-and-application-framework/tree/master/spark) framework with two join exercises using spark.
  - [Simple Join](https://github.com/juliaawu/coursera-hadoop-platform-and-application-framework/tree/master/spark/simple-join-assignment)
  - [Advanced Join](https://github.com/juliaawu/coursera-hadoop-platform-and-application-framework/tree/master/spark/advanced-join-assignment)
